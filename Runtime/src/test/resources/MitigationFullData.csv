Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon.

Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10 year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument ) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3) .";"Forests cover around 30% of the global landmass (in Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.  Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU forests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and globally. 
Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration of carbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and dead wood (up to forest gate). . 
Afforestation activities can deliver substantial mitigation through:
•	An increase in the forest capacity to sequester carbon from above ground and below ground carbon pools;
•	Maintenance and/or increase of the soil quality, soil carbon and biodiversity.
The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘afforestation’ and ‘reforestation’ to ‘existing forest management’ according to the LULUCF Regulations 20-year accounting rule as per Art. 5(3).
The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of long-term planning in national and regional regulations. 
The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:

1.	Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’.  The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest owners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally.  
•	SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and existing industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the Forest Europe general guidelines for sustainable forest management. 
•	To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome.
•	SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock land areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use change. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. ISCC and RSPO RED). 
•	Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of origin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable.
•	Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included as a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside the EU.
•	SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm criteria.
•	They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited.

2.	Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. Specifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) soil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of above-ground carbon pools only.
•	The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks.  
•	Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide. 

3.	Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years for afforestation projects. 
•	In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground biomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects.
•	SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from below-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from below ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it.
•	Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated after 20 years of the afforestation/reforestation project. This aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation where land that was afforested moves from category “afforestation” to “forest land” after 20 years. A 20-year period for maintaining carbon sinks and activities also follows the IPCC time frame of 20 years to saturation for soil carbon.
•	Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment.    

International relevance of the forest Taxonomy
It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in the EU , and around 20% of productive forests globally.  Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with certainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including carbon measurement and performance).

Alignment with existing legislation
In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments and established agreements. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article 29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or management systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to establish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can be assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding. ";"Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:
•	ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;
•	impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
•	pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer;
•	impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high ecological value to forests and illegal logging.
The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1).

•	Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, over the rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry’s levels of maturity, climate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an established forest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of the carbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function of many forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However, providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual increment, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time.  In practical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to the rotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (from baseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, but supported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon stocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years. 
•	Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level.

However, the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration to the increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general. It is therefore included explicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest . 

In the context of the Taxonomy, the category ‘reforestation’ applies in cases following extreme events (wind throws, fires etc.), and not as part of normal, legally binding obligation to reforest after harvesting.";"Reforestation shall increase overall carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon. 
All the Criteria are additive and shall apply together:

o	Maintain or improve the long-term capacity of the forest to deliver multiple services (e.g. ecosystem services, timber production, etc.); 
o	Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or after January 2008;
o	Carry out harvesting activities in compliance with laws in the country of origin ;
o	Regenerate harvested forests.
•	Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevant carbon pools at the beginning of the afforestation/reforestation activity;
•	Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management requirements and increase of carbon stock from above and below-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed through a forest management plan (or equivalent) at 10-year intervals, that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities.";"•	Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements is demonstrated and continuously disclosed at 10 -year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3).

The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide. 
•	Above ground Carbon stocks shall increase above carbon baseline over a period of 20 years . Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10 year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument ) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3) .";"Forests cover around 30% of the global landmass (In Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.  Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU forests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and globally. 
Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration of carbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and dead wood (up to forest gate). 
Reforestation activities can deliver substantial mitigation through:
•	An increase in the forest capacity to sequester carbon from above ground and below ground carbon pools;
•	Maintenance and/or increase of the soil quality, soil carbon and biodiversity.
The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘afforestation’ and ‘reforestation’ to ‘existing forest management’ according to the LULUCF Regulations 20-year accounting rule as per Art. 5(3).
The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of long-term planning in national and regional regulations. 
The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:

1.	Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’.  The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest owners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally. 
•	SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and existing industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the Forest Europe general guidelines for sustainable forest management. 
•	To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome.
•	SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock land areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use change. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. ISCC and RSPO RED). 
•	Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of origin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable.
•	Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included as a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside the EU.
•	SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm criteria.
•	They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited.

2.	Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. Specifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) soil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the tables focuses on the measurement of above-ground carbon pools only.
•	The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks.  
Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide. 

3.	Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criterion 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years for reforestation projects.
•	In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground biomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects.
•	SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from below-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from below ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it.
•	Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated after 20 years of the afforestation/reforestation project. This aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation where land that was afforested moves from category “afforestation” to “forest land” after 20 years. A 20-year period for maintaining carbon sinks and activities also follows the IPCC time frame of 20 years to saturation for soil carbon.
•	Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment.    

International relevance of the forest Taxonomy
It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in the EU , and around 20% of productive forests globally.  Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with certainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including carbon measurement and performance).

Alignment with existing legislation
In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article 29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or management systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to establish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can be assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding. ";"Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:
•	ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;
•	impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
•	pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer;
•	impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high ecological value to forests and illegal logging.
The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited.

•	No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislation

It is therefore proposed that existing forest management is recognized in the Taxonomy, provided it can demonstrate maintenance of high carbon stocks in multiple pools and overall improvement in the forest carbon sink.

3.	Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. A description of state of play is required every 10 years to ensure steady and overall progress is aimed for and achieved. That aligns with management cycles time horizons performed in the EU as well as National Forest Inventories, performed on a 10-year basis. 
•	In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground biomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects.

•	Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, over the rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry’s levels of maturity, climate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an established forest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of the carbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function of many forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However, providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual increment, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time.  In practical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to the rotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (from baseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, but supported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon stocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years. 
•	Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment.    
•	Harvesting practices, such as thinning, removals, final fellings, etc. will temporarily reduce the carbon stock and the potential to sequester carbon. However, such forest management activities should be eligible under Taxonomy, as long as SFM practices are in place; and that carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon are maintained or  increased, over the rotation period of the forest; or where selective removal of trees is required as part of the forest conservation plan. The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding, planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest.

All the Criteria are additive and shall apply together:
•	Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements:
o	Develop and implement a forest conservation plan that identifies the conservation objectives of the site and the necessary conservation measures. These shall include practices that maintain or increase existing carbon stocks, considering the non-exhaustive list of examples practices under Category C in Annex F2. These should allow for application of other similar approaches, that recognise local specificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soil quality, and biodiversity in line with conservation objectives;
o	Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or after January 2008;
o	Harvesting carried out in line with the conservation plan should be undertaken in compliance with the  laws in the country of origin ;
o	Any harvested forest should be regenerated after harvesting and in line with the forest conservation plan.
•	Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevant carbon pools at the beginning of the investment;
•	Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued maintenance and increase of carbon sinks from above-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed through a forest conservation plan (or equivalent) at 10-year intervals, that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities.";"•	Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements is demonstrated and continuously disclosed at 10 -year intervals through a forest conservation plan that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3).

Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees. Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon.

It is therefore proposed that conservation forests are recognised in the Taxonomy, provided they can demonstrate maintenance of high carbon stocks in multiple pools and overall improvement in the forest carbon sink.

Conservation forests are that in which the ‘primary designated management objective’ (FAO FRA definition) is that of conservation. Specifically, those forests where the management objectives are ‘conservation of biodiversity’ or ‘social services’ based on the FAO FRA definitions .

Box 2: FAO FRA definitions relating to conservation forests
1.	PRIMARY DESIGNATED MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE: The primary designated management objective assigned to a management unit. Explanatory notes:

b.	Primary management objectives are exclusive and area reported under one primary management objective should not be reported for any other primary management objectives.
c.	Nation-wide general management objectives established in national legislation or policies (such as e.g. “all forest land should be managed for production, conservation and social purposes”) should not be considered as management objectives in this context.
2.	CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY: Forest where the management objective is conservation of biological diversity. Includes but is not limited to areas designated for biodiversity conservation within the protected areas. Explanatory note:

b.	Excludes areas for subsistence collection of wood and/or non-wood forest products.

Forests cover around 30% of the global landmass (In Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.  Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU forests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and globally. 
Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration of carbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and dead wood (up to forest gate). . 
Conservation forestry activities can deliver substantial mitigation through:
•	An increase in the forest capacity to sequester carbon from above ground and below ground carbon pools;
•	Maintenance and/or increase of the soil quality, soil carbon and biodiversity.
The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘conservation forest’ to ‘existing forest management’ if the objectives of the forest management change; or to ‘restoration/rehabilitation’ or ‘reforestation’ should there be the loss of forest from force majeure. 
The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of long-term planning in national and regional regulations. 
The Taxonomy sets out the following qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three  criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:

•	Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest conservation. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’.  The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest owners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally.   For conservation forests, only the management activities listed under Category C in Annex F2 are required. 

•	Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to be maintained or increased and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. Specifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) soil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of above-ground carbon pools only.
•	The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks.  
•	Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide. 

•	Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criterion 1 as reported through a forest conservation plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. 
•	Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated over the duration of the investment
•	Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment.    
•	Considering the impact of climate conditions and changing environments the Taxonomy includes a clause for force majeure that states that underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds - and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy criteria.
International relevance of the forest Taxonomy
It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in the EU , and around 20% of productive forests globally.  Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with certainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including carbon measurement and performance).

Alignment with existing legislation
In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article 29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or management systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to establish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can be assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding. ";"Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:
•	ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;
•	impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
•	pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer;
•	impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high ecological value to forests and illegal logging.
The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy.";•	Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation. ;"•	Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:
-	The essential management practices are deployed consistently over the applicable perennial crop production area each year 
OR
-	Reduction in GHG emissions (gCO2e) in line with the following trajectory 

For example, a 20% reduction in GHG emissions would be required by 2030 compared to emissions in 2020, and a 30% emissions reduction would be required by 2040 compared to 2020 

2)	Maintain and increase existing carbon stocks for a period equal to or greater than 20 years through the application of appropriate management practices. 
This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:
-	The essential management practices^ are deployed consistently over the applicable perennial crop area each year
OR
-	Above and below ground carbon stocks (tC/ha) to be increased progressively over a minimum 20-year period*
* Noting the following exception:  For soils specifically, where it can be demonstrated that saturation levels have been reached, no further increase in carbon content is expected. In this case, existing levels should be maintained

3)	Production is not undertaken on land that had any of the following  status in or after January 2008 and no longer has that status. 

a)	wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year; 
b)	continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ; 
c)	 land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ ;
d)	peatland, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil. 

Methodological notes:
For those demonstrating compliance with the essential management practices:
-	The essential management practices are described in the table below. All essential practices will need to be deployed, except where particular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding.
-	In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment, this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a self-assessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required. 
-	To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed - taking into account crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - and their coverage on the farm.  To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools. 
-	For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds:
-	To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan. 
-	Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years, to show broad compliance with the requirement for carbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period, assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends.  It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage crops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations. 
-	For all users:
-	Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should include the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being used: 
o	CO2 emissions and removals in above ground biomass
o	CO2 emissions and removals in below ground biomass and soils
o	N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliser application, and those embedded in fertiliser production and fertiliser application
o	CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation and manure management) and some soils (e.g. wetlands) 
o	CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use
-	Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to be audited at 3-year intervals to confirm ongoing compliance with these requirements. 
-	In the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in non-compliance with these criteria.


Management category	Essential management practice 	GHG ¯ 	C-Seq ";"Opportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economy
An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the underlying goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050. 

In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbon sequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be met solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would struggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises the question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and the extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farms or other sectors. 

Furthermore, one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a whole is to switch from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities (for example, by reducing cattle numbers and increasing legume production as an alternative source of protein), with a corresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities. These criteria and thresholds, which focus specifically on emissions within the perennial crop production activity, cannot address this type of mitigation action. 

The criteria and thresholds proposed therefore focus on ensuring that emissions are substantially reduced and removals substantially increased at the economic activity (NACE code) level.

There is significant potential to reduce emissions, maintain carbon sinks, and increase sequestration through good practices in perennial cropland management. Each of these needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a net zero carbon economy. Doing so will ensure each instance of perennial cropland management maximises its contribution – this rationale drove the principles set out above. 

Approach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activity
There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such information existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice. 

However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm level is necessary. However, this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches. 

The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices, that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and there are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint. As such, it avoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above. 

Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric fermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and manure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential therefore predominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only 0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU’s agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous oxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely from livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, cooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm.  The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than 20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy source requirements. 

In respect of perennial cropland production, key sources of emissions are emissions associated with soil management and the application of fertilisers, and emissions embedded in post-harvest waste. 

Metrics and thresholds for this economic activity
On management practices that deliver substantial mitigation 
Rationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible mitigation practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration in perennial cropland management.  
For the purpose of establishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of perennial cropland  delivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008 , Paustian et al. 2016 , Kay et al. 2019 ).  
These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so as to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production – outcomes critical for the delivery of substantial mitigation - and/ or reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture, and also do not risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary effects nor are in conflict with legislation in the EU. These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range of biophysical and farming conditions.
Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and also indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial mitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally sustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential into individual farm-level mitigation potential, i.e.  what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG expert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied together for perennial cropland management to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.  
The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that, deployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level. It is noted that given heterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions impacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases.  The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, buffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and ditches, etc. Therefore, some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value. 

One best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced emissions or increased sequestration.  The rationale for including this practice is to raise awareness of where the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist to reduce those emissions and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities for carbon sinks, and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or audit of the assessment is required to fulfil this best practice requirement. This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds. The assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop, livestock production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use. If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period,  

On GHG emission reduction thresholds
Substantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net -negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to varying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or perennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should be consistent in the global context. 

A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016  suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between 0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as an approximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, not cumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for agriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective 2030 business as usual baselines” . As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions, they implicitly do not recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has been proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by work from Frank et al (2018) , and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007) .

In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al (2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to 2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points, relative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figure needed over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we move towards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications for any threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger (approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear between the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by 2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies implementation and communication.

The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture. However, establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation effectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was not in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved in 10 years-time and assess this against the target reduction. 

The threshold metric for emissions reduction is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such as gCO2e/ unit of production, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions intensity (e.g. through energy or resource efficiency) while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall – the overall goal.
 
On setting Carbon stock thresholds
Setting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential – which is very context specific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in line with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions (based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it is impractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specific area.  Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not truly context specific. 

Furthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting the relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of emissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction over 10 years for example can be expected to deliver a ‘substantial’ contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on agricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level of emissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global scale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing intensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical potential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in reducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management, including cropland management, grazing land management, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands. 

The proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20-year period. A 20 year period for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturation period. Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years, assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends.  It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage crops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations. 

On no conversion of high carbon stock land
A cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the operation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. This provides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated for this criterion.

On demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds
3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being delivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checking is required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions.

Methodological notes:
For those demonstrating compliance with the essential management practices:
-	The essential management practices are described in the table below. All essential practices will need to be deployed, except where particular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding.
-	In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment, this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a self-assessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required. 
-	To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed - taking into account crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - and their coverage on the farm.  To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools. 
-	For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds:
-	To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan. 
-	Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years, to show broad compliance with the requirement for carbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period, assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends.  It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage crops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations. 
-	For all users:
-	Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should include the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being used: 
o	CO2 emissions and removals in above ground biomass
o	CO2 emissions and removals in below ground biomass and soils
o	N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliser application, and those embedded in fertiliser production and fertiliser application
o	CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation and manure management) and some soils (e.g. wetlands) 
o	CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use
-	Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to be audited at 3-year intervals to confirm ongoing compliance with these requirements. 
-	In the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in non-compliance with these criteria.


Management category	Essential management practice 	GHG ¯ 	C-Seq ";"Opportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economy
An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the underlying goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050. 

In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbon sequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be met solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would struggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises the question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and the extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farms or other sectors. 

Furthermore, one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a whole is to switch from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities (for example, by reducing cattle numbers and increasing legume production as an alternative source of protein), with a corresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities. These criteria and thresholds, which focus specifically on emissions within the perennial crop production activity, cannot address this type of mitigation action. 

The criteria and thresholds proposed therefore focus on ensuring that emissions are substantially reduced and removals substantially increased at the economic activity (NACE code) level.

There is significant potential to reduce emissions, maintain carbon sinks, and increase sequestration through good practices in perennial cropland management. Each of these needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a net zero carbon economy. Doing so will ensure each instance of perennial cropland management maximises its contribution – this rationale drove the principles set out above. 

Approach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activity
There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such information existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice. 

However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm level is necessary. However, this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches. 

The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices, that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and there are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint. As such, it avoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above. 

Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric fermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and manure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential therefore predominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only 0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU’s agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous oxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely from livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, cooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm.  The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than 20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy source requirements. 

In respect of perennial cropland production, key sources of emissions are emissions associated with soil management and the application of fertilisers, and emissions embedded in post-harvest waste. 

Metrics and thresholds for this economic activity
On management practices that deliver substantial mitigation 
Rationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible mitigation practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration in perennial cropland management.  
For the purpose of establishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of perennial cropland  delivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008 , Paustian et al. 2016 , Kay et al. 2019 ).  
These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so as to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production – outcomes critical for the delivery of substantial mitigation - and/ or reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture, and also do not risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary effects nor are in conflict with legislation in the EU. These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range of biophysical and farming conditions.
Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and also indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial mitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally sustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential into individual farm-level mitigation potential, i.e.  what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG expert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied together for perennial cropland management to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.  
The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that, deployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level. It is noted that given heterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions impacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases.  The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, buffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and ditches, etc. Therefore, some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value. 

One best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced emissions or increased sequestration.  The rationale for including this practice is to raise awareness of where the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist to reduce those emissions and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities for carbon sinks, and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or audit of the assessment is required to fulfil this best practice requirement. This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds. The assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop, livestock production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use. If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period,  

On GHG emission reduction thresholds
Substantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net -negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to varying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or perennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should be consistent in the global context. 

A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016  suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between 0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as an approximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, not cumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for agriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective 2030 business as usual baselines” . As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions, they implicitly do not recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has been proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by work from Frank et al (2018) , and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007) .

In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al (2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to 2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points, relative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figure needed over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we move towards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications for any threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger (approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear between the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by 2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies implementation and communication.

The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture. However, establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation effectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was not in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved in 10 years-time and assess this against the target reduction. 

The threshold metric for emissions reduction is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such as gCO2e/ unit of production, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions intensity (e.g. through energy or resource efficiency) while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall – the overall goal.
 
On setting Carbon stock thresholds
Setting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential – which is very context specific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in line with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions (based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it is impractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specific area.  Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not truly context specific. 

Furthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting the relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of emissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction over 10 years for example can be expected to deliver a ‘substantial’ contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on agricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level of emissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global scale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing intensive production system.

The proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20-year period. A 20 year period for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturation period.

-	The essential management practices are described in the table below. All essential practices will need to be deployed, except where particular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding.
-	In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment, this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a self-assessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required. 
-	To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed - taking into account crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - and their coverage on the farm.  To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools. 
-	For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds:
-	To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan. 
-	For all users:
-	Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should include the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being used: 
o	CO2 emissions and removals in above ground biomass
o	CO2 emissions and removals in below ground biomass and soils
o	N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliser application, and those embedded in fertiliser production and fertiliser application
o	CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation and manure management) and some soils (e.g. wetlands) 
o	CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use
-	Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to be audited at 3-year intervals to confirm ongoing compliance with these requirements. 
-	In the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in non-compliance with these criteria.

An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the underlying goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050. 

In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbon sequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be met solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would struggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises the question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and the extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farms or other sectors. 

The criteria proposed in the Taxonomy do not attempt to address this question directly and instead focus on ensuring that emissions are reduced and that removals increase at the economic activity (NACE code) level.

While livestock production, and in particular ruminant livestock production (beef, lamb, dairy), is a significant source of emissions in the agriculture sector it is included in the Taxonomy due to the significant short-term mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestock management, and in particular long-lived greenhouse gases (N20, CO2), through good practices on the farm. In the short term, emission reductions associated with improved nitrogen use efficiency and manure management are substantial, with overall positive impacts on farm level economics. Each of these needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a net zero carbon economy. Doing so ensures each instance of livestock management maximises its contribution – this rationale drove the principles set out above. 

However, it is important to note that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasing beyond a certain point and to move towards net-zero targets by mid-century, reduced emissions intensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumption patterns and overall reduced per-capita consumption of livestock products, especially beef, lamb and dairy products. This implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste, as well as structural transformations in the agricultural sector. Significant and coordinated policy efforts will be required to manage both behavioural changes on the side of consumers and to incentivise and manage structural change in the agri-food supply chain At this point, the Taxonomy cannot address such shifts, but can only point to significant short-term potential associated with efficiency gains. Future Taxonomy updates should, however, consider these aspects. 

Approach taken to setting thresholds for livestock production
There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such information existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation. 

However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit of production) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm level is necessary. But this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches. 

The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices, practices that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in different types of agriculture. This qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and there are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will additional investment finance to do so,  it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint, so avoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above. 

Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric fermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and manure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e). And they are predominantly from reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only 0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU’s agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous oxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely from livestock and rice cultivation).  In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, cooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm.  The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than 20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy source requirements.

In relation to livestock management, mitigation potential derives from improved animal health planning, lower-emission feeding strategies, and reducing emissions from manure management and waste treatment (Buckley et al. 2015 , Chadwick et al 2011 , Miselbrook et al 2014 ). 

Metrics and thresholds
On management practices that deliver substantial mitigation 
Rationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible mitigation activities available in livestock production to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration. 

For the purpose of the Taxonomy, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008 , Paustian et al. 2016 , Kay et al. 2019 ).  

The identified practices include activities that reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture and do not risk leakage effects, and also do not risk negative ancillary effects or are in conflict with legislation in the EU. These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range of biophysical and farming conditions. 

Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories or individual practices and also indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial mitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally sustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential into individual farm-level mitigation potential, i.e.  what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG expert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied together for each NACE activity code to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.  

The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that, deployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation from livestock production at farm level. It is noted that given heterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions impacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases.  
The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, buffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and ditches, etc. Therefore, some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value. 

One best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced emissions or increased sequestration.  The rationale for including this practice it to raise awareness of where the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities for carbon sinks, and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or audit of the assessment is required. This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds. The assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop, livestock production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use. If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period,  

On GHG emission reduction thresholds
Substantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net -negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to varying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or non-perennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should be consistent in the global context. 

A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016  suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between 0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as an approximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, not cumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for agriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective 2030 business as usual baselines” . As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions they implicitly do not recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has been proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by work from Frank et al (2018) , and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007) .

In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al (2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to 2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points, relative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figure needed over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we move towards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications for any threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger (approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear between the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by 2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies implementation and communication.

The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture. However, establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation effectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was not in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved over the specified period and assess this against the target reduction. 

The threshold metric is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such as gCO2e/ unit of production, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions intensity (e.g. through efficiency improvements) while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall – the overall goal. 

On setting Carbon stock thresholds
Setting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential – which is very context specific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in line with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions (based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it is impractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specific area.  Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not truly context specific. 

Furthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting the relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of emissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction can be expected to deliver a ‘substantial’ contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on agricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level of emissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global scale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing intensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical potential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in reducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management, including cropland management, grazing land management, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands. 

The proposal therefore is to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks (confirmed at 3-year intervals) over a 20 year period. 

On no conversion of high carbon stock land
A cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the operation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. This provides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated for this criterion.

On demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds
3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being delivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checking is required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions. 

To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools. Advisory support will likely be required in the process of preparing the plan and may also be required to ensure adequate implementation of the plan..";"The activity livestock production captures a distinct set of sub-activities that would include intensive and extensive forms of livestock rearing, as well as the management of permanent grassland.

(A)	Cement clinker: 
Specific emissions (calculated according to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks) associated to the clinker production processes are lower than the value of the related EU-ETS benchmark.
As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmark value for cement clinker manufacturing is: 0.766 tCO2e/t of clinker  
(B)	Cement: 
Specific emissions associated to the clinker and cement production processes are lower than: 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement or alternative binder ";"Cement production is responsible for more than 70% of the emissions under C.23 and concrete is the most significant application for the use of cement. Cement is the main constituent of concrete. The content of cement in the concrete and total GHG emissions can vary significantly based on the specifications of the application that concrete will be used for. For this reason, manufacturing of concrete (Concrete - NACE C.23.6) is not covered by the sustainable Taxonomy. 
Cement manufacture includes three main stages: 
1.	Raw materials preparation;
2.	Clinker production; 
3.	Grinding of clinker with other components such as gypsum, fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and fine limestone to produce the finished cement. 
Typically, 30‑40% of direct CO2 emissions comes from the combustion of fuels; the remaining 60‑70% comes from the chemical reactions involved in converting limestone to calcium oxide .
Reducing the emissions from the manufacturing process of cement can therefore positively contribute to the mitigation objective. 
The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum acceptable carbon intensity that the activity should comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to the mitigation objective. 
ETS product benchmarks have been selected as one of the thresholds for cement clinker production. They reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector. 
Within cement manufacture, the following activities were taken into account:
1.	Process emissions: Emissions from the calcination process for the production of cement clinker
2.	Fuel emissions: Energy required for the calcination process during the clinker production

The cement production facilities that meet the identified threshold are expected to achieve thermal energy intensity in the range of 2.9 – 3,4 GJ/t clinker.

•	Cement clinker: Specific emissions: 0,766 tCO2e/t of clinker (EU‐ETS) 
•	Clinker to cement ratio:  0.65 
•	Specific emissions: 0.766x0.65 = 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement (or alternative binder)

Electricity: Indirect emissions from the use of electricity during the clinker and cement production 
The main users of electricity in cement plants are the mills (grinding of cement, milling of raw materials) and the exhaust fans (kiln/raw mill and cement mill, which together account for more than 80% of the electrical energy usage. The electricity demand in cement plants ranges from 90 to 150 kWh/t cement . 
A global average electric energy demand for cement manufacturing of 104 kWh/t cement was reported by Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) for the years 2012 to 2014 . The CSI data cover more than 900 plants worldwide, and all technologies and clinker and cement types. The variations in the data are significant: The 10% best in class show figures of 85 kWh/t cement and below, while the 90% percentile amounted to 129 kWh/t cement.
Taking into account that the decarbonisation of the cement sector will run in parallel with the decarbonisation of the energy sector, it is expected that the electricity required (as auxiliary power) for cement manufacture in the near future will come from renewable sources and thus a specific threshold for specific electricity consumption is not proposed. Based on the above-mentioned information and sources, it is expected that the best in class plants have specific electricity consumption of 85 KWh/ t cement. 

•	Improving energy efficiency: Thermal energy intensity of clinker and the electric intensity of cement can be reduced by deploying existing state-of-the-art technologies in new cement plants and retrofitting existing facilities to improve energy performance levels when economically viable. 
•	Switching to alternative fuels: The carbon intensity of cement clinker can be reduced significantly by the use of biomass and waste materials as fuels in cement kilns. The clinker-burning process offers good conditions for using different types of waste materials replacing parts of the consumption of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. A wide range of different types of wastes can be used as fuels but as these can replace primary fuel in cement kilns, a consistent waste quality is essential (e.g. adequate calorific value, metal, halogen and ash content).
•	Reducing the clinker to cement ratio: Increasing the use of blended materials and the market deployment of blended cements is very important for the decarbonisation of the sector and alignment with a low carbon pathway.  This requires substitution of cement clinker by mineral additives such as fly ash, silica fume or blast-furnace slag. The amount of clinker substitute that can be blended in the cement depends on the type of substitute and the type of cement produced. Some mineral additives, e.g. GBFS, allow for substitution levels of over 70 per cent. Revision of the cement and concrete standards, building codes and public procurement regulations would be required in order to allow more widespread use of blended cements with very high substitution of clinker (e.g. >60%) while ensuring product reliability and durability at final application.
•	Alternative clinkers and binders: Alternative clinker formulations (e.g. belite, CSA, BCSA, CACS, MOMS) and alternative binders (e.g. alkali-activated binders) could offer potential opportunities for CO2 emissions reductions by using different mixes of raw materials or alternatives compared to Portland cement. Their commercial availability and applicability differ widely. Further efforts are required to support the demonstration, testing and earlier stage research for alternative clinkers and binders and to develop standards to facilitate market deployment. The specification of the benchmark based on ton of binder will allow investments in these types of novel alternative binders to be considered for eligibility under the EU Sustainable Taxonomy.
•	Renewable energy generation and use: Electricity supplied from renewable energy sources could be explored as a measure to reduce carbon  intensity of the final cement product. This can be achieved through different strategies including implementing renewable-based captive power generation, power purchase agreements that ensure electricity imports are provided from renewable sources or demand-side response strategies that enable a flexible electricity demand (e.g. a flexible operating strategy of grinding plants throughout the day). Various renewable-based options are available for cement manufacturers including wind power, solar photovoltaic power, solar thermal power and small hydropower generation. Potential deployment of these technologies in cement plants is highly dependent on local conditions.
•	Transportation emissions: The emissions from transportation are excluded as these represent only a small percentage of the total emissions of cement manufacture.

Additionally, they are the only consistent data set available today. 
The ''Achievable Reference Performance'' specific emissions values, as defined in the standard EN 19694-2:2016, are considered to be accessible to any operator under normal operating conditions and therefore such specific emission values are less strict than the proposed EU ETS benchmarks. Therefore, the EU ETS benchmarks have been selected because they provide an ambitious threshold under which the steel and iron making industry should strive to operate in the short-term.

-	Scope 1: All direct emissions related to the production (the process direct emissions and the emissions due to fuel use for energy production).
-	Note on the electricity:
According to the methodology to calculate ETS benchmarks, emissions from electricity are considered where direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity are to a certain level interchangeable (as is the case for carbon black but not for soda ash). 
For chlorine, the value corresponding to an efficient level of electricity  consumption was selected as the threshold given that the main source of energy used for the production of chlorine is electricity and by improving the energy efficiency of the process, as well as using low carbon electricity sources,  the activity can substantially contribute to the climate change mitigation objective.

Mitigation measures  are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years)  that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actions ";"For the manufacturing of all chemicals covered in this activity except the manufacture of the following CPA product categories: 20.14.32, 20.14.33, 20.14.34; the selected metric is:
•	Emission factor: GHG emissions per unit of production (tCO2e/t)
GHG emissions must be calculated according to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks.

For the manufacturing of the organic chemicals falling under the codes: 
•	20.14.32
•	20.14.33 
•	20.14.34
the following criterion shall apply:
•	the manufacturing of the organic chemicals shall be wholly or partially based on renewable feedstock and,
•	the carbon footprint shall be substantially lower compared to the carbon footprint of the same chemical manufactured from fossil fuel feedstock. The carbon footprint shall be calculated in accordance with ISO 14067:2018 and validated by a third party.
For the purpose of applying these criteria, renewable feedstock refers to biomass, industrial bio-waste or municipal bio-waste.

Additional criteria the activity needs to comply with: 

If feedstock is biomass (excluding industrial and municipal bio-waste):
-	a full traceability of sourcing through the corresponding chain of custody management system needs to be in place and its effectiveness proven through the corresponding certification systems;
-	any forest biomass used in the process shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable; 
-	any forest biomass used in the process is committed to forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited in the forest areas. Forest management and chain of custody practices in sourcing areas that are not yet certified, must be aligned (roadmap to certification) with the same certification standards; 
-	forest biomass coming from irrigated forest plantations shall not be used;
-	any biomass produced and used in the process must be subject to a transparent, credible chain of custody and comply with biomass sustainability criteria as defined in the cross compliance conditionalities of the Common Agricultural Policy and as defined in the Common Fisheries Policy;
-	Biomass used shall comply with align with the requirements defined under the  directives RED + and RED2+ as applicable for biomass and biofuels and with the requirements for biomass defined in the forestry section  in this Taxonomy. Biomass shall not come from agricultural land that has been the subject of land use change from forest or pasture since2008 (Aligned with RED). The above-mentioned certification schemes shall provide a robust chain of custody audit system for the feedstock;  
-	products derived from new, greenfield oil palm tree plantations are excluded from the scope; 
-	particular case of forest biomass certification: small-scale palm oil cultivators operating in existing forest plantations should be able to be included in the certification system and ensure that they receive their fair share of profits.

If feedstock is industrial bio-waste (incl. waste from the food or feed industries) or municipal bio-waste: 
-	any solid bio-waste used in the manufacturing process shall originate from source-segregated and separately collected (non-hazardous) waste streams, i.e. shall not be separated from mixed residual waste;  
-	the bio-waste used in the process shall be consistent with the waste regulatory framework and the national/regional/local waste management plans, in particular with the proximity principle. Where municipal bio-waste is used as a feedstock, the project shall be complementary to and not compete with existing municipal bio-waste management infrastructure.

If the manufacturing processes for any of the organic chemicals for which the ETS benchmarks are used as thresholds is based on renewable feedstock, then the criteria for the renewable feedstock also apply.

ETS product benchmarks only for the manufacturing of all chemicals covered in this activity except the manufacturing of the following CPA product categories: 20.14.32, 20.14.33, 20.14.34: 
a)	For HVC: 0,702 tCO2e/t 
b)	For aromatics: 0,0295 tCO2e/t 
c)	For vinyl chloride: 0,204 tCO2e/t
d)	For styrene: 0,527 tCO2e/t 
e)	For ethylene oxide/ethylene    glycols: 0,512 tCO2e/t 
g)           For adipic acid 2,79 (allowances/t).";"For the manufacturing of all chemicals in this activity except CPA codes 20.14.31, 20.14.32, 20.14.33, 20.14.34:
The manufacturing of high value chemicals, aromatics, ethylene chloride, vinyl chloride, ethylbenzene, styrene, ethylene oxide, mono ethylene glycol and methanol accounts for more than 35% of the emissions from the chemical sector. 
Steam cracking is the main industrial process for manufacturing high value chemicals, but is also the most energy intensive one in the chemical industry and responsible for 25% of the GHG emissions from the chemical industry. 
Reducing the emissions from the manufacturing process of organic chemicals can therefore positively contribute to the mitigation objective. 
The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum acceptable carbon intensity that the activity should comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to the mitigation objective. 
ETS product benchmarks have been selected as thresholds. They reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector. 
Emissions covered:
-	Scope 1: All direct emissions related to the production (the process direct emissions and the emissions due to fuel use for energy production).
-	Note on electricity:
According to the methodology to calculate ETS benchmarks, emissions from electricity are considered where direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity are to a certain level interchangeable.

The thresholds have been aligned with the work undertaken in the respective forestry subgroup. The following principles have been applied where biomass use is relevant:
-	All Sustainable Forestry Management requirements have EU legislation as minimum baseline. The Forest Taxonomy includes this overarching principle’ Carry out harvesting activities in compliance with national laws ‘ and refers to EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and FLEGT.
-	The Taxonomy doesn’t include forest plantations – because of the mitigation focus. We do recognize the international guiding principles against deforestation provided by UN REDD, as an overarching principle.

For the manufacturing of chemicals under CPA codes 20.14.31, 20.14.32, 20.14.33, 20.14.34:
Art. 6 of the Commission’s proposed regulation on a framework to facilitate sustainable investment includes “switching to use of renewable materials” to provide a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The innovative bio-based chemical sector may contribute to that objective. Therefore, additional criteria have been specified to identify the conditions under which the manufacturing process of organic chemicals - when based on renewable feedstock, such as biomass - can substantially contribute to the mitigation objective. 
“Bio-based chemicals are defined as chemical products that are wholly or partly derived from materials of biological origin (for example biomasses, feedstock, but also plants, algae, crops, trees, marine organisms and biological waste). Given their expected limited environmental footprint in comparison to their traditional counterparts, bio-based chemicals have recently emerged on EU markets as valid, environmentally friendly alternatives to standard chemicals”. ";"The main potential significant harm to the environment from the production of other organic chemicals is associated with: 
•	polluting emissions to air and water from the production process; 
•	vulnerable ecosystems might be damaged by the construction and/or operation of the production facilities;
•	the use of water resources for production purposes (e.g. cooling water) in water stressed areas; and

•	Combined CO2 emissions (scope 1 emissions and scope 2 emissions, from electricity consumed) lower than 1,3 tCO2/tAmmonia.
For the calculation of the emissions from the manufacturing process of ammonia, both the steps: production of the intermediate product hydrogen and synthesis of the ammonia are considered. Scope 1 emissions include both emissions.
GHG emissions must be calculated according to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks.";"The manufacturing of ammonia and nitric acid accounts for approximately 23% of emissions coming from the chemical sector.  Reducing emissions from the manufacturing processes can positively contribute to the mitigation objective.
The ammonia sector is expected to substantially contribute to GHG emissions reduction, notably by using hydrogen produced from electrolysis.   
During the manufacturing process of nitric acid, the main type of GHG generated is nitrous oxide and by applying the available technologies it is possible to achieve more than 80% of emission reductions. 
The selected metric for nitric acid is the emission factor, in terms of XX GHG emissions per unit of production. The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum acceptable carbon intensity of the manufacturing process that the activity should comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to the mitigation objective. 
The selected threshold for nitric acid is the ETS product benchmark. ETS product benchmarks reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector.

C - Manufacturing;C21;C20.1;C20.1.6;Manufacture of plastics in primary form;Manufacture of plastics in primary form;"The manufacturing of plastics is associated with significant life cycle CO2 emissions. There are many types of plastics which are used in the production of multiple end products. The Taxonomy seeks to avoid including manufacture of products that do not have a positive impact in mitigation. Disposable plastic products are highly energy inefficient and undermine efforts to contribute to mitigation. 
In this context, plastic manufacturing is only eligible when at least 90% of the final plastic is not used for single use consumer products and is not recycled. This needs to be confirmed needs to be confirmed from science based research/studies etc. 
Mitigation measures  are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years)  that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actions ";"Manufacture of plastics in primary form shall comply with at least one of the following three criteria and when relevant with the additional criteria, reported below: 
1)  The plastics in primary form is manufactured by mechanical recycling
2) The plastics in primary form is manufactured by chemical recycling including: chemical depolymerisation (aka monomerisation), pyrolysis, gasification, solvent-based purification of polymers  etc.. When applying criterion 2, the carbon footprint of the plastics in primary form, manufactured by chemical recycling (excluding any calculated benefit from the production of fuels), shall be lower when compared to the carbon footprint of the plastics in primary form manufactured with fossil fuel feedstock. The carbon footprint shall be calculated in accordance with ISO 14067:2018 and validated by a third party.
3) Manufacture of plastics in primary form shall be wholly or partially derived from renewable feedstock and the carbon footprint of the plastics in primary form, manufactured wholly or partially from renewable feedstock shall be lower when compared to the carbon footprint of the plastics in primary form manufactured with fossil fuel feedstock. The carbon footprint shall be calculated in accordance with ISO 14067:2018 and validated by a third party.

For the purpose of applying criterion 3, renewable feedstock refers to biomass, industrial bio-waste or municipal bio-waste.

Additional criteria the activity needs to comply with: 

Single use consumer products: Independent sector study confirms that at least 90% of the type of plastic manufactured is:
(1) not used for single use consumer products, or
(2) based on recycled plastics as feedstock.

If feedstock is biomass (excluding industrial and municipal bio-waste):
-	a full traceability of sourcing through the corresponding chain of custody management system needs to be in place and its effectiveness proven through the corresponding certification systems;
-	any forest biomass used in the process shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable; 
-	any forest biomass used in the process is committed any forest biomass used in the process is committed to forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited in the forest areas. Forest management and chain of custody practices in sourcing areas that are not yet certified, must be aligned (roadmap to certification) with the same certification standards; 
-	forest biomass coming from irrigated forest plantations shall not be used;
-	any biomass produced within the EU used in the process must be subject to a transparent, credible chain of custody and comply with biomass sustainability criteria as defined in the cross compliance conditionalities of the Common Agricultural Policy and as defined in the Common Fisheries Policy;
-	Biomass used shall comply with align with the requirements defined under the  directives RED + and RED2+ as applicable for biomass and biofuels and with the requirements for biomass defined in the forestry section  in this Taxonomy.. 
-	biomass shall not come from agricultural land that has been the subject of land use change from forest or pasture since 1994. The above-mentioned certification schemes shall provide a robust chain of custody audit system for the feedstock;  
-	products derived from new, greenfield oil palm tree plantation are excluded from the scope; 
-	particular case of forest biomass certification: small-scale palm oil cultivators operating in existing forest plantations should be able to be included in the certification system and ensure that they receive their fair share of profits.
If feedstock is industrial bio-waste (incl. waste from the food or feed industries) or municipal bio-waste: 
-	any solid bio-waste used in the manufacturing process shall originate from source segregated and separately collected (non-hazardous) waste streams, i.e. shall not be separated from mixed residual waste;  
the bio-waste used in the process shall be consistent with the waste regulatory framework and the national/regional/local waste management plans, in particular with the proximity principle. Where municipal bio-waste is used as a feedstock, the project shall be complementary to and not compete with existing municipal bio-waste management infrastructure;";"Plastics production has been sharply growing over the last years and emissions from the plastics sector are expected to increase, not only because consumption is expected to increase – and so also the emissions from the manufacturing process - but also because plastics release CO2 when incinerated. 
In order to reduce CO2 emissions from the plastics sector it is therefore important to promote reduction in use of disposable consumer plastics, and promote increase in materials recirculation and manufacture of polymers with renewable feedstock.
The manufacturing sector has a role to play in improving the contribution of the plastics supply chain to climate mitigation. It can contribute significantly to reducing the quantities of available disposable consumer plastics in the market but has limited control on the use of plastics.

Note on the link between manufacturing activity under NACE code 20.16 and code 22.2.
The manufacturing of plastics in primary form is covered by NACE code 20.16 and the definition of “primary form” includes: liquids and pastes, blocks or irregular shape, lumps, powders (including molding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms.  The manufacturing of plastic products falls under the NACE code 22.2. 
When setting the criteria for activity 22.2, for the purpose of objective 4 under Article 5 of the Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment] (24.5.2018, COM(2018) 353 final, 2018/0178 (COD)  , the pursuing of which can also positively contribute to objective 1, it is recommended that the criteria for activity 22.2 take into account the criteria established for activity 20.16. 
It follows that the criteria for activity 22.2 should aim to promote:
•	the manufacture of plastic products which are substantially based on recycled plastics in line with the EU strategy for plastics,  to minimize the production of virgin plastics, and
•	the manufacture of plastic products which are based on plastics in primary form, which are wholly or partially derived from renewable feedstock.  ";"The main potential significant harm to the environment from the production of plastics in primary form is associated with: 
•	polluting emissions to air and water from the production process; 
•	vulnerable ecosystems might be damaged by the construction and/or operation of the production facilities;
•	the use of water resources for production purposes (e.g. cooling water) in water stressed areas); and 
•	the generation of hazardous wastes. 
The production of polymers includes a lot of synthesis, hence, in order to allow a clear demarcation and in order to NOT go beyond the limits of this sector 20.16 it has to be acknowledged that precursors are covered under C.20.11, C.20.13, C.20.14; C.20.15.";•	Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation. ;"•	Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

•	The European System shall be defined as the interconnected electricity system covering the interconnected control areas of EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
•	The annual average System grid emissions factor is calculated as the total annual emissions from power generation, divided by the total annual net electricity production in that System.
•	The rolling five-year (average) period used in determining compliance with the thresholds shall be based on historic data, and shall be include the year for which the most recent data is available.
•	Transmission Systems may include generation capacity connected to subordinated Distribution Systems.
•	Distribution Systems subordinated to a Transmission System that is deemed to be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation may also be deemed to be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation. 
•	To determine eligibility, it is possible to consider a System covering multiple control areas which are interconnected and with significant energy exchanges between them. In such a case, the weighted average emissions factor across all included control areas is used to determine eligibility, and individual subordinated transmission or distribution systems within this System will not be required to demonstrate compliance separately.
•	It is possible for a System to become ineligible after having previously been eligible. In Systems that become ineligible, no new T&D activities are eligible from that moment onward, until the system is again in compliance with the threshold (except for those activities which are always eligible, see above). Activities in subordinated Systems may still be eligible, if these subordinated Systems meet the criteria of this Taxonomy.
•	A direct connection or expansion of an existing direct connection to production plants includes infrastructure that is indispensable to carry the associated electricity from the power generating facility to a substation or network.
";"Increasing access to electricity will support its decarbonisation by enabling more consumers to transition from carbon-intensive energy supply, while increasing the utilisation of renewable energy. As countries continue to fulfil their decarbonisation objectives, there will be fewer and fewer investments in transmission and distribution which are not climate aligned. 

Under this logic, we propose that most investments in electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure in Systems where a significant majority of new generation capacity is from low carbon generation sources should be considered climate-aligned under the EU Taxonomy. ";The impacts of transmission and distribution lines are a function of the spatial alignment of the grid, the structures and conductors required for various voltages, the extent to which pre-existing corridors are used, and how the transmission and distribution lines are operated and maintained. The most common environmental impacts of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure are visual, ecosystem and land use. In the cases of underground offshore electricity lines, water and marine resources may be impacted.;•	Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation. ;"Underground power lines:

Electricity storage can support the integration of renewable energy systems into electricity transmission and distribution. It can balance centralized and distributed electricity generation, while also contributing to energy security.

An average energy consumption of a water supply system of 0.5 kwh per cubic meter billed/unbilled authorized water supply indicates a high performing system in terms of energy consumption. Several energy efficiency measures can reduce directly the energy consumption in a water supply system, enabling significant reductions of GHG emissions, these are inter alia:

No threshold applies.";"Sewage sludge is a by-product of waste-water treatment, with organic and inorganic content. The organic content of the sludge is subject of decomposition which might occur under controlled circumstances (in sludge treatment installations) or under un-controlled circumstances in the final disposal, with significant GHG emissions (mainly methane).
Anaerobic Digestion (AD) and in some cases aerobic digestion are examples of sludge treatments. In AD microorganisms decompose the organic matter of the sludge (in the absence of oxygen) and produce methane-rich biogas.
The primary climate mitigation effect of biogas is it’s use a source of renewable energy in multiple forms and applications displacing fossil fuels.  As an additional contribution to climate mitigation the sludge can be turned into a recyclable product (e.g. as fertilizer substituting synthetic fertilizers). 
Sludge treatment is in many cases centralized in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which treat the sludge and produce energy from sludge produced in the WWTP or outside the plant. 
Methane leakage may offset the climate mitigation benefits and needs to be avoided. A specific monitoring plan is therefore needed to detect methane leakages from relevant facilities. Where increasing methane emissions are detected, it is in the own interest of the operator to remove the causes through technical or operational measures in order to minimize economic losses.

As part of an integrated waste management system, AD is a valid route to divert biodegradable waste from landfilling and thus reduce the uncontrolled emissions of landfill gas, in particular methane. The AD process produces methane-rich biogas under controlled conditions, and a sludge-like or liquid residue, termed ‘digestate’. Biogas can be used in multiple forms and applications that displace fossil fuels. 
The digestate is typically used on farmland as organic fertilizer, directly or after a composting step. The use of digestate instead of synthetic fertilizers derived from by-products of the petroleum industry saves energy and reduces the consumption of fossil fuels. Where there is no immediate use on farmland, the digestate can be dewatered and ‘cured’ by composting to stabilise the material, which can be stored for longer time and used as an organic fertiliser or soil improver. 
For the treatment of kitchen and food waste as well as other similar bio-waste, AD exhibits the best environmental and climate change mitigation performance compared to other forms of biological treatment and should therefore be given preference where it is technically and economically viable. This depends on several local conditions.  
On the other hand, biodegradable garden and park wastes and other bio-waste with high ligneous content are typically not directly degradable by AD. Where such bio-waste fraction is significant, it should be collected separately and treated by composting (see Taxonomy Activity “Composting of bio-waste”).
Co-digestion of bio-wastes with solid or liquid manure and other agricultural residues as well as energy crops is sometimes practised to improve the stability of the AD process and increase biogas yields and is eligible under the conditions mentioned in the metrics. Due care needs to be taken however to ensure that the use of the digestate (or composts produced therefrom) as a fertilizer/soil conditioner is not negatively affected by such practice. 
Methane leakage may offset the climate mitigation benefits and therefore needs to be avoided. Specific monitoring is therefore needed to detect methane leakages from relevant facilities. Where increasing methane emissions are detected, it is in the interest of the operator to remove the causes through technical or operational measures in order to minimize economic losses.

•	the compost produced is used as fertiliser/soil improver .
No threshold applies.";"Composting describes the process by which microorganisms decompose biodegradable waste in the presence of oxygen, which is why it is sometimes also referred to as “aerobic digestion”. 
As part of an integrated waste management system, composting is a valid route to divert biodegradable waste from landfilling and thus reduce the uncontrolled emissions of landfill gas, in particular methane. Composting makes organic matter more resilient to further degradation.
The end product is compost which can be used as a natural fertilizer or soil improver in agriculture, horticulture and hobby gardening (provided it is of a sufficient quality). The use of compost instead of synthetic fertilizers – e.g. derived from by-products of the petroleum industry – saves energy and reduces the consumption of fossil fuels. Other climate mitigation effects of compost use include the long-term carbon capture in soils. 
For the treatment of kitchen and food waste as well as other similar bio-waste, anaerobic digestion (AD) exhibits the best environmental and climate change mitigation performance compared to other forms of biological treatment and should therefore be given preference where it is technically and economically viable. This depends on several local conditions (see JRC publication referred to above). 
On the other hand, biodegradable garden and park wastes and other bio-waste with high ligneous content are typically not directly degradable by AD and therefore better suited for composting. 
Methane emissions from composting may offset the climate mitigation benefits and therefore needs to be minimized. Selection of proper feedstock and state of the art operational process management is needed to minimize methane leakages from the composting process.";"The main potential significant harm linked to this activity is related to:
•	emissions to air, soil and water from the operation of the composting plant;
•	the use of the resulting compost as fertiliser / soil improver which may also result in soil and water pollution due to contaminants in the compost.

The threshold is based on ‘near-zero energy building’ (NZEB) requirements, which are defined in national regulation implementing the EPBD and are mandatory across EU Member States from 2021. To be eligible, the net primary energy demand of the new construction must be at least 20% lower than the primary energy demand resulting from the relevant NZEB requirements.  This reduction can be met through a direct decrease of the primary energy demand via a more efficient design or by offsetting with on-site and off-site renewable generation, or a combination of both strategies. Off-site energy generation must be limited to district heating, cooling systems and local renewable energy sources. 
The methodology used for the measurement of floor area must be declared by referring to the categories established by the International Property Measurement Standards. ";The establishment of a relative threshold in the form of a percentage improvement on NZEB requirements is justified by the fact that from 2021 new constructions will be mandated by national/regional building regulations to comply with NZEB requirements. This implies that the taxonomy must require better levels of performance than NZEB, or all new constructions would be automatically eligible, which would fail to direct finance towards more sustainable solutions and run the risk of diverting finance from the renovation of existing buildings. Since NZEB requirements correspond to different levels of performance across EU Member States , the use of a percentage improvement, rather than absolute figures, allows a degree of proportionality to be applied: in Member States where NZEB requirements result in a comparatively low PED, the energy reduction necessary to achieve the 20% improvement is smaller than in Member States  where NZEB requirements result in a comparatively high primary energy demand.;"The main potential for significant harm to the other environmental objectives associated with the construction of new buildings is determined by:

A renovation is eligible when it meets either one of the following thresholds:
a)	Major renovation: the renovation is compliant with the requirements set in the applicable building regulations for ‘major renovation’ transposing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)
b)	Relative improvement: the renovation achieves savings in net Primary Energy Demand of at least 30% in comparison to the baseline performance of the building before the renovation.  The baseline performance and predicted improvement shall be based on a specialised building survey and validated by an accredited energy auditor. The methodology used for the measurement of floor area must be declared by referring to the categories established by the International Property Measurement Standard. ";"The choice of a threshold based on the requirements for ‘major renovation’ is strongly affected by the necessity of substantially increasing the annual rates of renovations that include energy-efficiency measures. Such requirements are established in EU Member States at national or regional level in building regulations implementing the EPBD and are based on calculations of cost-optimality. Access to advantageous financing conditions is meant to incentivise homeowners and businesses to undertake a renovation that includes energy efficiency measures.
The threshold for ‘relative improvement’ is given as alternative to allow the eligibility of renovations that may not meet the ‘major renovation’ requirements but still deliver considerable energy savings, as well as to provide a threshold that is easily applicable outside EU Member States.
Since the focus of the criteria is the renovation project and not the building in itself, any renovation can be eligible, independently from the absolute performance of the building as long as it meets either one of the two thresholds.";"The main potential for significant harm to the other environmental objectives associated with the renovation of existing buildings is determined by:

L - Real estate activities;L68;;;Acquisition and ownership of buildings;Building acquisition and ownership: this activity relates to NACE code L68 “Real estate activities”.;"The acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle instead of lower-performing ones can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives. While specific data on embodied carbon and thus carbon emissions from the full lifecycle is still limited and needs to be further generated, the acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions during the use phase can already make an important contribution by directing users towards high-performing properties and by sending signals to markets about the need to lift the overall energy performance of the whole stock.
For large non-residential buildings (i.e. buildings with an effective rated output for heating systems or systems for combined space heating and ventilation of over 290 kW, or buildings with floor area  over 1000 m2), an additional requirement is introduced to ensure that these buildings are operated efficiently, and that actual energy and carbon savings are delivered each year.
Condition for non-eligibility: to avoid lock-in and undermining the climate mitigation objective, the acquisition and ownership of buildings for the purpose of extraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels are not eligible.
Use of alternative schemes as proxies: outside EU Member States, established schemes such as ‘green building’ certifications or building regulations may be used as alternative proof of eligibility, provided that this is verified by the Sustainable Finance Platform. The organisation responsible for the scheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting evidence that a specific level of certification/regulation can be considered equivalent (or superior) to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold established for the relevant climatic zone and building type. The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application.";"The metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED): the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building life-cycle (i.e. ‘module B6’ according to EN15978), calculated ex-ante according to the national methodologies for asset design assessment, or as defined in the set of standards ISO 52000, expressed as kWh/m2 per year.

Case A – Acquisition of buildings built before 31 December 2020

The calculated performance of the building must be within the top 15% of the local existing stock in terms of operational Primary Energy Demand, expressed as kWh/m2y.
Alignment with this criterion can be demonstrated by providing adequate evidence comparing the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the local stock built before 31 December 2020. Such evidence should be based on a representative sample of the building stock in the respective area where the building is located, distinguishing at the very least between residential and non-residential buildings. The area can be defined as a city, a region or a country. 
Certification schemes such as EPCs may be used as evidence of eligibility when adequate data is available to demonstrate that a specific level (e.g. EPC A) clearly falls within the top 15% of the respective local stock.
The TEG recognises that more work needs to be done to collect and analyse data in order to define absolute thresholds corresponding to the performance of the top 15% of each local stock, such as data showing the distribution of EPCs across the stock and the thresholds used to define EPC ratings.
Large non-residential buildings must meet an additional requirement: efficient building operations must be ensured through dedicated energy management. 

Case B – Acquisition of buildings built after 31 December 2020
The building must meet the criteria established for the ‘Construction of new buildings’ that are relevant at the time of the acquisition. 
Large non-residential buildings must meet an additional requirement: efficient building operations must be ensured through dedicated energy management.";"The acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle instead of lower-performing ones can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives by:
•	creating demand for such buildings; this in turn will stimulate owners to build and renovate buildings to a higher level of performance than they would have done otherwise.
•	sending a clear signal to the market that the acquisition of such buildings against an ever more stringent legislative background and changing client preferences can help reduce future potential risk and value depreciation.
For buildings built after 2020, the same criteria established for the activity ‘Construction of new buildings’ are applied. Buildings built before 2021 are assessed on the basis of a best in class approach in each local stock. Rather than attempting to establish absolute thresholds with an incomplete set of data, for the time being the TEG opted for a threshold based on a percentage of the stock, which ensures a level-playing field across different Member States. For now, the corresponding 15% was deemed an appropriate level for the best in class performance, finding a compromise between the need to establish high standards of performance while recognising the need to maintain and create opportunity in the existing market.";"The main potential for significant harm to the other environmental objectives associated with the acquisition of buildings is determined by:
•	Lack of resistance to extreme weather events (including flooding), and lack of resilience of to future temperature increases in terms of internal comfort conditions.
•	Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances.
•	Presence of asbestos and/or substances of very high concern in the building materials.

Brief Rationale
The construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon land transport is considered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy. Eligibility for infrastructure is linked to eligibility criteria for fleets using the infrastructure, with additional criteria relating to zero carbon transport (active mobility) 
";"The construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon land transport is considered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy. 
Criteria 3. above would accommodate all electric rail lines and non-electrified lines with battery powered and hydrogen trains operating. However even if non-electrified, there might be a case for renewal of rail infrastructure in order to ensure continuity of the service while alternative powered trains (hydrogen, battery) are deployed in the future years, hence the inclusion of criteria 4 above. There is no significant risk of lock-in in those cases where the fleet is due for renewal.
In criteria 3 above, “predominantly used for” should be interpreted to mean that the majority of the use of the infrastructure is by fleets meeting the substantial contribution criteria in other land transport activities identified in the taxonomy. Where there may be greater uncertainty in fleet use e.g. estimations based on future projections, a more conservative approach should be applied to ensure that the predominant use requirement will be met.   
There is requirement that only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transport service is eligible. Infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation are those infrastructure that are needed to ensure the day-to-day delivery of a transport service e.g. tracks, IT equipment ensuring service delivery, ticket offices and fleet maintenance facilities. It does not include ancillary infrastructure that do not directly ensure delivery of the operation of the fleet e.g. head offices of the transport operator. 
For the criteria that “infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossil fuels is not eligible”, the term “dedicated”  is defined as infrastructure being built and acquired with the explicit intention to transport or store fossil fuels, even if actual use may serve other purposes as well. 	
It is acknowledged that embedded carbon emissions in infrastructure projects (e.g. upstream emissions from manufacture of construction materials) may be significant in certain circumstances. The level of uncertainty around data in this respect makes it challenging at this time to incorporate this consideration within thresholds for infrastructure. However, this element should be considered for ongoing work on the Taxonomy. Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change and therefore is excluded.

The Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation uses a g CO2/km metric. To convert this to a g CO2/tonne-km metric, the average payload for the road freight vehicles should be applied. Once reference value data is available, it is expected that the taxonomy will specify CO2e/tkm threshold values.";"The carbon intensity of freight rail, even if diesel, is in most cases significantly lower than road freight transport, rail freight transport at least meeting the threshold proposed in the road transport HDV criteria is eligible.

Emissions intensity can vary significantly depending on the type of cargo transported. This criterion should be reviewed in 2025.
Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change and therefore is excluded.

This threshold is therefore stringent while it provides some flexibility to recognize highly efficient systems and advanced hybrid technology.
Diesel and petrol cars still represent the immense majority of the road fleet in all countries and the penetration of electric vehicles will materialize at a yet unknown pace.

The definition is aligned with the heavy duty CO2 regulation, which provides the most recent legislative point of orientation. Road freight transport with low-emission heavy-duty vehicles defined in the same regulation and dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowly defined range of bio- or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relatively high challenges in electrifying this vehicle category.

Key reference point for thresholds: Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 setting CO2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles and amending Regulations (EC) No 595/2009 and (EU) 2018/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directive 96/53/EC

-zero emission heavy-duty vehicle means a heavy-duty vehicle without an internal combustion engine, or with an internal combustion engine that emits less than 1g CO2/kWh (or 1g CO2/km for certain N2 vehicles)
-Low-emission heavy-duty vehicle means a heavy-duty vehicle, which is not a zero emission heavy-duty vehicle, with specific CO2 emissions of half of the reference CO2 emissions of all vehicles in the sub-group to which the heavy-duty vehicle belongs. The reference CO2 emissions shall be based on the monitoring data reported pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/956 for the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020.
Life-cycle and well-to-wheel considerations for thresholds is pending on the feasibility to develop and agree a common Union methodology:
Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation Recital (42) : It is important to assess the full life-cycle emissions from heavy-duty vehicles at EU level. To this end the Commission should no later than 2023 evaluate the possibility of developing a common Union methodology for the assessment and the consistent data reporting of the full life-cycle CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles that are placed on the Union market. The Commission should adopt follow-up measures, including, where appropriate, legislative proposals.
By contrast to light duty vehicles, the electrification of trucks is currently limited to small demonstration fleets. Especially for heavy trucks for regional and long-haul operations, fuel substitution to advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option in the medium term .

Brief rationale:
Passenger transport with zero tailpipe emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because the generation of these energy carriers is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future. Dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowly defined range of bio- or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relatively high challenges in electrifying the vehicle category typically used on interurban routes. Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line with the agreed taxonomy regulation. The threshold of 50gCO2e/pkm relates to the thresholds set for passenger cars (assuming occupancy of one) and represents a value that is significantly below average new car emissions. ";"The threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO2/vkm) and significantly lower than average diesel car (290 gCO2/vkm ). The criteria is based on actual ridership (passenger-km) and not capacity offered (seat-km or places-km). This should be justified through real monitoring data from operations or ex-ante demand assessments.
Unlike urban buses, zero tailpipe emission vehicle technologies are not commercially available, therefore the threshold should be reviewed in or prior to 2025, rather than specifying now that only zero direct emissions will be eligible at that point, to analyze the modal shift comparison with cars in interurban transport, and technology developments in the sector.  
With no commercial availability of zero tailpipe emission vehicles for this activity, fuel substitution to advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option for some transport modes in the medium term as identified in the EC Long term strategy :
“for those transport modes where the deployment of zero emission vehicles is unfeasible due to energy density requirements or technology costs, carbon neutral fuels (i.e. advanced biofuels and biomethane, as well as e-fuels) can be deployed for use in conventional vehicle engines”.

•	Vessels that are dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or any blended fossil fuels are not eligible even if meeting the criteria above
Brief rationale:
Zero direct emissions inland waterway transport (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because: 
•	With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transport modes. 
•	The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future 
The threshold of 50% lower than average reference CO2 emissions of HDVs  ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road freight vehicles, with a review in 2025 to assess technology developments in the freight transport sector. The Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation uses a g CO2/km metric. To convert this to a g CO2/tonne-km metric, the average payload for the road freight vehicles should be applied. Once reference value data is available, it is expected that the taxonomy will specify CO2e/tkm threshold values.

Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line with the agreed taxonomy regulation.";"The threshold of 50% of the HDV reference value relates to the thresholds set for road freight vehicles and freight rail. If inland freight water transport operations can at least match the thresholds of those modes, it is deemed to be making a substantial contribution as it is significantly lower emissions than average road freight emissions. 
The threshold should be reviewed in or prior to 2025, rather than specifying now that only zero direct emissions will be eligible at that point, to analyse the modal shift comparison with cars, and technology developments in the sector.
Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change and therefore is excluded.  
With limited availability of zero tailpipe emission fleets for this activity, fuel substitution to advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option for some transport modes in the medium term. The EC Long term strategy .
The operation of fleets where fossil fuels are substituted with low- or net-zero carbon fuels such as advanced bio- and synthetic fuels can make a substantial contribution to CO2 net emissions savings in the transport sector. , , ,  This criteria only applies for vessels that have a specified minimum level of efficiency. The criteria for producing these fuels are set elsewhere in the Taxonomy. 
As an example of how this might work in practice, an operator may seek to operate a new or existing fleet solely using an eligible fuel (e.g. advanced fuel). To meet the Taxonomy criteria, the operator would need to demonstrate through ongoing verification that the fleet was solely using biofuels as specified in the criteria. A financier may be able to claim its investment (e.g. in a new fleet) was Taxonomy eligible through a contractual agreement with an operator to solely use biofuels, also establishing a verification system to enable ongoing monitoring.";"The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the operation of inland passenger and freight water transport are summarised as follows:
•	Direct emissions to air of carbon oxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), as well as noise emissions .
•	Waste generation (hazardous and non-hazardous) during maintenance and end-of-life of the vessel.
•	Direct and indirect emission of pollutants in water. ";•	Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation. ;"•	Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

H - Transporting and storage;Not defined;;;Passenger cars and commercial vehicles;Passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and category L vehicles;Passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and category L vehicles (this includes all M1, N1 and L category vehicles including where applicable NACE 49.32, 53.10, 53.20, 77.11);"CO2 emissions per vehicle kilometre (gCO2/km). 
For passenger cars and light commercial vehicles:
•	Zero tailpipe emission vehicles (incl. hydrogen, fuel cell, electric). These are automatically eligible. 
•	Vehicles with tailpipe emission intensity of max 50 g CO2/km (WLTP) are eligible until 2025.
•	From 2026 onwards only vehicles with emission intensity of 0g CO2/km (WLTP) are eligible.
For category L vehicles:
Zero tailpipe emission vehicles (incl. hydrogen, fuel cell, electric).
Brief rationale:
Zero direct emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen) are eligible because the generation of the energy carriers used by zero tailpipe emissions vehicles is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future
Vehicles with tailpipe emission intensity of max 50 g CO2/km (WLTP) are eligible until 2025 because the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans sets this threshold as an ambitious mid-term target that is significantly below the expected average emissions of new cars and vans. The 50 g CO2/km threshold does not apply to L vehicles (e.g. motorcycles) due to their lower weight and high electrification potential. ";"This activity includes operation of all vehicles classified as M1, N1, as defined by Regulation (EU) 2018/858, and of vehicles classified as category L (2- and 3-wheel vehicles and quadricycles) as defined in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013. It also applies to NACE code 49.32 Taxi operation, NACE code 53.10 Postal activities under universal service obligation, NACE code 53.20 Other postal and courier activities, and NACE 77.11 Rental and leasing of cars and light motor vehicles where these activities may include the operation of eligible vehicles.
Zero direct emission vehicles and vehicles with low and reducing emission intensities contribute substantially to climate mitigation and are aligned with Article 6. 1. (c) increasing clean or climate-neutral mobility, and Article 6. 1. (f) phasing out anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, including from fossil fuels, 
Zero direct emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen) are eligible because: 
- the generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future (for instance, in the scenario called EUCO 3038 that meets the EU targets in the clean energy package, 70% of electricity in the EU is generated from decarbonized sources in 2030). 
Point of reference for thresholds:
Clean Vehicles Directive (CVD - Directive (EU) 2019/1161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 amending Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/1161/


The revised Directive includes ambitious and binding procurement targets for each EU member state using harmonized definition what a clean-vehicle is. The notion of clean-vehicle is principally aligned with aim of the Taxonomy and the proposed Art 6.1.c (above). The transition element is also built into the CVD. 
The relevant definitions for light duty vehicles are aligned with the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans. Taken together, these two pieces of EU legislation reflect the latest thinking on ambitious and sufficiently mature performance metrics. The potential for synergies is significant when the Taxonomy is aligned to the legislative thresholds for clean vehicles. It will reduce market uncertainty in terms of what are green vehicles to manufacture and operate- both from the demand and supply side.
 
Life-cycle and well-to-wheel considerations for thresholds is pending on the feasibility to develop and agree a common Union methodology:
The Clean Vehicles Directive acknowledges that life-cycle and well-to-wheel emission are to be addressed at a later point in time (recital 31): The possible reflection of life cycle CO2 emissions and of well-to-wheel CO2 emissions of vehicles for the period after 2030 should be considered taking into account relevant provisions of Union law for their calculation at that point in time.
By 31 December 2027, the Commission should review the implementation of Directive 2009/33/EC. In its review the Commission should also assess, inter alia, the possibility of aligning this Clean Vehicles Directive to any methodology for counting life-cycle CO2 emissions and well-to-wheel CO2 emissions developed in the context of EU vehicle CO2 emission performance standards.
The new CO2 Regulation for cars and vans (EU) 2019/631 mandates in Art. 7 (10) that:
The Commission shall no later than 2023 evaluate the possibility of developing a common Union methodology for the assessment and the consistent data reporting of the full life-cycle CO2 emissions of light duty vehicles that are placed on the Union market. The Commission shall transmit that evaluation, including where appropriate proposals for follow-up measures, such as legislative proposals, to the European Parliament and the Council.";"Key environmental aspects to be considered for investments on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are the following:
•	Direct emissions to air from the exhaust gases of internal combustion engine: nitrogen oxides (NOx ), total hydrocarbon (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and particle number, and from tyre abrasion and brakes friction and noise emissions
•	Indirect emissions to air from the production of fuels and energy carriers. However, this is out of the control of vehicles manufacturers and operators.
•	Waste generation (hazardous and non-hazardous) during maintenance and end-of-life of the vehicle.
•	Recycling of materials in order to reduce consumption of critical raw materials and impact on ecosystems and natural capital.  
The manufacture of vehicles, particularly batteries, is part of the scope of the sub-group ""Manufacture of low carbon transport vehicles, equipment and infrastructure""";•	Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation. ;;;;"•	Compliance with EU and national legislation on hazardous waste generation, management and treatment.

•	Tyres must comply with the (revised) Tyre labelling regulation . It includes noise labelling requirements but not requirements on tyre abrasion. However, the proposal of revision envisages a test method to be developed: A suitable testing method to measure tyre abrasion is not currently available. Therefore, the Commission should mandate the development of such a method, taking into full consideration all state-of-the-art internationally developed or proposed standards or regulations, with a view to establishing a suitable testing method as soon as possible.
•	Tyres must comply with the noise requirements set by Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 on type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles .
